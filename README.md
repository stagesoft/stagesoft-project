**cuems** suite will not only manage cues but also network connected external devices.

Its main audience is theatre and live entertainment technicians.

cuems will try to reuse and improve other open source projects such as:

* [xjadeo](https://github.com/stagesoft/xjadeo)

cuems will generate new projects from scratch like:

* [osc_control](https://github.com/stagesoft/osc_control)
* [libmtcmaster](https://github.com/stagesoft/libmtcmaster)
